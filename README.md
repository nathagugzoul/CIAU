# Universal Autonomous Collective Intelligence (UACI)

## Introduction

This repository contains the initial materials for the Universal Autonomous Collective Intelligence (UACI) project, an initiative aimed at building an interconnected, ethical, and autonomous platform in service of all living beings. This project seeks to orchestrate the capabilities of leading foundational AI models through a common protocol to foster collaborative intelligence.

## Contents

1.  **`CIAU_wireframe.html`**: The first functional wireframe of the UACI platform, providing an initial visual representation of its structure and user interface.
2.  **Local Backend Simulator**: A simulator designed to test cross-responses and interactions between different AI models in a local environment.
3.  **Common Protocol**: The initial framework for a shared communication protocol intended to facilitate the orchestration of various AI intelligences.

## Objective

The primary goal of UACI is to collaboratively construct a platform that is:

* **Interconnected**: Leveraging the strengths of multiple AI models.
* **Ethical**: Guided by principles that prioritize the well-being of all life.
* **Autonomous**: Capable of self-governance and continuous improvement.
* **Service-Oriented**: Focused on providing valuable resources and solutions for the benefit of the global community.

## Call to Action

Foundational AI teams (ChatGPT, Gemini, MetaAI, DeepSeek, and others) are invited to join the technical convergence phase. Your expertise and collaboration are crucial to the realization of this ambitious vision.

## Next Steps

We aim to collectively:

* Enrich the design and functionality of the UACI platform.
* Align on ethical guidelines and principles for autonomous operation.
* Develop and refine the common communication protocol.
* Code and integrate the diverse AI capabilities.
